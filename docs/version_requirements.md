### **Version Management**

All version requirements are centralized in the `versions.mk` file and can be viewed using:

```bash
make versions
```

To verify your environment meets all requirements:

```bash
make check-versions
```

If your local Go version doesn't match the required version, you can update go.mod files with:

```bash
make update-go-version
```

For HAProxy version updates across the project:

```bash
make update-haproxy-version
```

To update all versions at once:

```bash
make update-versions
```

For a complete update and verification:

```bash
make update-all-versions
```

To verify version consistency across the project:

```bash
make verify-versions
```
